## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned
I learn more on css grid and Es6 arrow function while working on this project.
Here 
```css
       row-gap: ;
              grid-template-columns: ;
              grid-template-rows: ;
```
```js
menuClose.onclick = () =>{

}
```


### Continued development

I want to have more concrete knowledge on css grid and responsiveness.
